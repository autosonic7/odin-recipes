        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne or gochujang</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>8 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>1 small Asian pear, peeled, cored and quartered (or use an ordinary pear or tart apple)</li>
        <li>1 1-inch chunk of ginger, peeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced red or green hot pepper, optional</li>
        <li>Ssamjang (spicy Korean soybean paste), for dipping, optional</li>
        <li>Steamed rice, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse short ribs in cold water, pat dry and place in a wide shallow bowl. In another bowl, mix together soy sauce, brown sugar, rice wine, sesame oil, black pepper and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Put onion, garlic, pear and ginger in the work bowl of a food processor. Grind ingredients to a smooth purée, then add to soy sauce mixture. Add sesame seeds. Thin with ¼ cup water. Pour marinade over short ribs and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Bring to room temperature, drain and discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook short ribs on a hot grill or under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until nicely browned but juicy. Pile grilled meat on a platter and serve immediately with lettuce leaves on the side. Accompany with sliced hot peppers, ssamjang and steamed rice, if desired.</li>
